All notable changes to Fynlo are documented here.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-05-26 *(Draft — pending release per `RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md §4`)*

### Fixed
- **C01 — Recalculate Balances no longer destroys payment history.** Legacy borrowers and debts whose partial repayment was tracked only on the cumulative `paid` field (with `paidPrincipal == paidInterest == 0` and no rows in `payments` / `debt_payments`) had `paid` silently zeroed on every tap of Recalculate. The fix is structural: `payments` and `debt_payments` are the **single source of truth** for repayment history; `paid` is a derived projection re-computed from `SUM(payments)`. (UX_AUDIT §C01; ADR `decisions/2026-05-26-c01-fix-strategy.md`; commits `331c1ae` Stage 1, `5a00d4a` Stage 2.)
- `setup-gradle@v3` × Gradle 9 incompatibility — every `./gradlew` invocation in CI was failing in 6s with `Cannot get the value of write-only property 'removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan'`. Upgraded to `@v4` in both workflows.
- `kotlinx-serialization` × `room-testing` runtime incompatibility — `room-testing:2.8.4` was compiled against `kotlinx-serialization 1.8.x` (where `GeneratedSerializer.typeParametersSerializers()` has a default implementation), but the project pinned `1.7.3` where it's still abstract. `MigrationTestHelper.loadSchema` failed with `AbstractMethodError` on every test. Bumped `kotlinxSerialization` `1.7.3 → 1.8.1` in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Bump also covers `androidx.room:room-testing:2.8.4 androidTestImplementation` (previously stuck at `2.6.1`).

### Added
- **Schema migration `v15 → v16`** — one-time backfill on first launch: every borrower / debt with `paid > 0` and no rows in `payments` / `debt_payments` gets one synthetic `Payment` (or `DebtPayment`) row with `amount = paid`, `principal = paid`, `interest = 0`, `date = loanDate`, `type = "Legacy backfill"`, notes recording that the actual repayment date is genuinely unknown. Total `paid` is preserved exactly. Schema export `app/schemas/.../16.json` committed.
- **`RecalculateBalancesDataIntegrityTest`** — Robolectric-backed JVM test exercising real Room SQL against an in-memory `FynloDatabase` in three cases: legacy borrower with backfilled Payment, current-schema borrower with split Payment row, brand-new borrower with zero payments. All three green in CI.
- **`FynloDatabaseMigrationTest`** — instrumented test (`app/src/androidTest/`) using Room's classic `MigrationTestHelper`. Five cases: backfills a legacy borrower, leaves an already-populated borrower untouched, mirrors for the debts side, leaves `paid = 0` borrowers untouched, and re-opens the database with full Room afterwards to catch schema-validation drift. All five passed on CPH2767 / Android 16 against the real `v15 → v16` migration code path. Schemas are exposed to the test APK via `sourceSets["androidTest"].assets.srcDirs("$projectDir/schemas")`. Requires a connected device/emulator (`./gradlew :app:connectedProdDebugAndroidTest`); CI integration via Firebase Test Lab is a follow-up.
- **Data-integrity CI gate** — `.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs an explicit `--tests '*DataIntegrity*' --tests '*Recalculate*'` Gradle filter on every push / PR, so a regression cannot pass silently in the test log. (Closes INF04 in `UX_AUDIT §9`.)
- **ADR directory** `decisions/` with the C01 fix-strategy ADR (Michael Nygard format: Status / Context / Decision / Consequences / Alternatives considered).
- **Release notes directory** `release_notes/` with `3.2.2.md` (Play Store copy + migration disclosure + in-app banner draft + pre-release checklist).
- **`§6 Journal`** section added to `PROJECT_STATE_FOR_AI.md` (referenced by the preamble's reading-order block but never created).

### Changed
- **`FinanceRepository.recalculateAllBalances()`** rewritten: no longer calls the destructive `recalculateBorrowerPaid` / `recalculateDebtPaid` DAO queries (`UPDATE ... SET paid = paidPrincipal + paidInterest`). Now derives `paid` exclusively via `rebuildBorrowerPaidFromPayments` / `rebuildDebtPaidFromDebtPayments`, with the `WHERE EXISTS (payments)` gate removed and `SUM(...)` wrapped in `COALESCE(..., 0)` so brand-new borrowers land at `paid = 0` (not NULL).
- **`FinanceRepository.editTransaction`** Loan / Debt Repayment branches: editing a repayment transaction now does delete-old-Payment + insert-new-Payment + rebuild, instead of mutating `paid` directly. Sync now also pushes the Payment / DebtPayment delete (was a latent sync-correctness gap).
- **`FinanceRepository.deleteTransaction`** Loan / Debt Repayment branches: the "no matching Payment" fallback that reversed `paid` directly is removed. When no Payment matches the transaction's amount/date, `paid` is left as-is — consistent with the invariant `paid == SUM(payments)`.
- **`FinanceRepository.insertPaymentWithDest` / `insertDebtPaymentWithSource`**: the conditional `updateBorrower/DebtPaid{Amount,Principal,Interest}` writers are replaced by a single `rebuild...FromPayments` call after the Payment row is inserted.
- `PROJECT_STATE_FOR_AI.md` `Version` header bumped from stale `1.8.0` to `3.2.1` (matches `app/build.gradle.kts` `versionName`); §0.4 / §0.5 reflect C01 closure with structural guardrails for future agents.

### Removed
- **10 DAO methods** that allowed direct mutation of derived columns:
  - `updateBorrowerPaidAmount` / `updateBorrowerPaidPrincipal` / `updateBorrowerPaidInterest`
  - `updateDebtPaidAmount` / `updateDebtPaidPrincipal` / `updateDebtPaidInterest`
  - `recalculateBorrowerPaid` / `recalculateDebtPaid` *(the destructive queries that motivated the entire C01 ADR)*
  - `seedPaidPrincipalFromPaid` / `seedDebtPaidPrincipalFromPaid` *(dead code — their logic lives inline in migrations 11→12 / 12→13 / 15→16)*
- Matching repository wrappers on `LendingRepository` and `DebtRepository`.

### Security / data integrity
- **`paid == SUM(payments)` is now structurally enforced.** No DAO method exists that lets new code violate the invariant without first re-adding one of the ten deleted queries — and that re-introduction would be visible in code review and would fail the data-integrity CI gate.

### Performance
- Cold start ~4 % faster in Partial AOT mode (the production ship mode), up to ~10 % on devices with fully cold caches. Driven by the baseline profile bundled in the APK via `baseline-prof.txt` + `profileinstaller`. Measured on CPH2767 / Android 16, 2026-05-24; see `PROJECT_STATE_FOR_AI.md §5.6`.

### Infrastructure
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is now **committed** to the repository (was gitignored with a misleading "optional — keeps repo lighter" comment; broke `./gradlew` on every fresh clone, including all CI runs). `.gitignore` corrected.
- `gradlew` committed with executable bit (`100755`) instead of `100644`.
- `gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3` → `@v4` in `android.yml` and `checks.yml` (Gradle 9 compatibility).
- Android Lint baseline (`app/lint-baseline.xml`) adopted: existing 41 errors + 174 warnings are filtered; new lint errors still fail CI. (Notable real issue inside the baseline: `windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode` in `values-night/themes.xml` requires API 27 but `minSdk` is 26 — flagged for a real fix in a follow-up.)
- `paths-ignore: ['**/*.md', 'docs/**']` on Android workflows — docs-only commits no longer trigger ~15 minutes of CI per commit. Workflow files themselves are deliberately not ignored.
- Governance documents added at repo root: `LEGAL_PROTOCOL.md`, `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`, `TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md`, `RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md`, `DATA_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md`, `BACKUP_PROTOCOL.md`, `INCIDENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `PRIVACY_PROTOCOL.md`, `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_PROTOCOL.md`, `ANALYTICS_PROTOCOL.md`, `ONBOARDING_PROTOCOL.md`, `ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md`, `SUNSET_PROTOCOL.md`, `GOVERNANCE_README.md`, `AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `LINT_RULES.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `UX_AUDIT_2026-05-25.md`, plus `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/workflows/checks.yml`, and `docs/privacy.md` / `docs/terms.md` for the GitHub Pages legal mirror (`docs/_config.yml` site title set to `Fynlo Legal`).

### Skipped
- **3.2.1** was an internal milestone (the governance / CI hygiene commits) and is intentionally never promoted to Play Store production — `RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md §8`'s hard rule: *"Do NOT promote 3.2.1 to production. Skip directly to 3.2.2."*

### Still TODO before 3.2.2 ships
*(Not blockers for the changelog entry itself, but listed here so the release procedure has a single source of truth.)*

- `app/build.gradle.kts` `versionName` / `versionCode` bump (`3.2.1` → `3.2.2`, `124` → `125`).
- Instrumented migration test (`androidx.room:room-testing` `MigrationTestHelper` for `v15` → `v16`) — `RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md §8` gate 3.
- `UX_AUDIT_2026-05-25.md §C01` status flip to "Closed in 3.2.2" once the tag lands.
- Macrobenchmark re-run + smoke test (`RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md §3.4`, §3.5).
